					<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
					<p class="subdued">Effective Date: June 2025</p>

					<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Puffin app (“App”) developed by George Will (“Developer”). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

					<h4>1. Use of the App</h4>
					<p>The Puffin app is intended for personal, non-commercial use to help individuals track and reduce their vape and nicotine consumption. You agree not to misuse the app, reverse engineer it, or use it in any unlawful manner.</p>

					<h4>2. Eligibility</h4>
					<p>You must be at least 18 years old to use this app. By using the app, you confirm that you meet this requirement.</p>

					<h4>3. Data and Privacy</h4>
					<p>The App stores your data locally on your device. Some anonymous usage data (e.g., screen views, feature interactions) may be collected via Firebase Analytics to help improve the app. No personally identifiable data is collected or shared. If iCloud support is enabled, your data may be backed up privately in your iCloud account. Please refer to our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

					<h4>4. Subscriptions</h4>
					<p>Puffin may offer optional in-app purchases or subscriptions for premium features. These are billed via Apple’s App Store and are subject to their terms. Auto-renewing subscriptions are managed by Apple and must be canceled via your Apple ID settings.</p>

					<h4>5. No Medical Advice</h4>
					<p>Puffin is a personal tracking tool and does not provide medical advice. It is not a substitute for professional medical care or guidance. Always consult a healthcare professional if you are looking to quit or reduce nicotine usage.</p>

					<h4>6. Changes to the App</h4>
					<p>We may update or discontinue features in the app at any time. These changes may be made without prior notice and without liability.</p>

					<h4>7. Limitation of Liability</h4>
					<p>The app is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. The Developer is not liable for any damages or losses arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to data loss, inaccuracy, or dependency on tracked data.</p>

					<h4>8. Modifications to These Terms</h4>
					<p>These Terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
