					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p class="subdued">Effective Date: June 2025</p>

					<p><strong>Puffin</strong> is a personal vape tracking app designed to help individuals reduce or better understand their nicotine consumption. We value your privacy, and this policy explains what data we collect, how it’s used, and how you can control it.</p>

					<h4>1. Data Collection</h4>
					<p>Puffin does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). All user-entered data — including vape sessions, puffs, nicotine levels, and settings — is stored locally on your device.</p>
					<p>To help improve the app and understand feature usage, Puffin uses Firebase Analytics, a privacy-focused analytics tool provided by Google. This collects aggregated, anonymous data such as screen views, session length, and feature interaction (e.g., tapping buttons, completing challenges).</p>
					<p>No personal identity, vape content, or sensitive user data is transmitted or stored externally.</p>

					<h4>2. iCloud & Device Sync</h4>
					<p>If iCloud sync is enabled (optional and coming in a future update), your app data may be stored in your personal iCloud account. This is managed by Apple, and we do not access or store that data.</p>

					<h4>3. Subscriptions & Payments</h4>
					<p>All subscriptions are handled securely through Apple’s in-app purchase system (StoreKit). We do not store or process any payment or billing information. You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime through your Apple ID settings.</p>

					<h4>4. Analytics</h4>
					<p>Puffin uses Firebase Analytics to gather anonymous usage statistics, such as which features are used most and how often the app is opened. This helps improve the app over time and guide development priorities.</p>
					<p>Analytics collection is strictly anonymous and aggregated. You can disable analytics at any time in the app settings under Preferences → Allow Anonymous Usage Analytics.</p>
					<p>No advertising identifiers (IDFA) are used. No data is sold, shared, or used for cross-app tracking.</p>

					<h4>5. Push Notifications</h4>
					<p>With your permission, Puffin may send local notifications (e.g., cooldown reminders or streak updates). These are scheduled and managed entirely on-device. No notification content is sent to external servers.</p>

					<h4>6. Children’s Privacy</h4>
					<p>Puffin is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect any information from minors.</p>

					<h4>7. Changes to This Policy</h4>
					<p>This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We recommend checking back periodically.</p>

					<h4>8. Contact</h4>
					<p>If you have any questions or concerns about your data or this policy, please contact:</p>
